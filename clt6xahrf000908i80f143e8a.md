Have you ever wondered how your computer knows where to find a website when you type in its address? Well, let me tell you about DNS - the Domain Name System. Think of it like a phonebook for the internet! Instead of looking up someone's phone number, DNS helps your computer find the right website when you type in a web address.

So, when you type in a website address like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com), your computer doesn't automatically know where to find it. Just like when you don't know someone's phone number, your computer asks a DNS server for help. The DNS server looks up the website's IP address (which is a unique number that identifies a website's location on the internet) in its directory. Kind of like when you search for someone's phone number in the phonebook.

Once the DNS server finds the IP address, it sends it back to your computer. Your computer then knows where [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) is located and can connect to the website's server to load the page. It's just like using the phone number to dial and connect to the person you were trying to reach!

So, DNS acts like the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable website addresses into machine-readable IP addresses, allowing your computer to find and connect to websites on the internet. Pretty cool, isn't it?

### What is the relation between DNS and BIND?

The Domain Name System (DNS) can be thought of as a huge phonebook for the internet. It contains entries that match website names (such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) to their corresponding phone numbers (IP addresses).

BIND is a special software that reads the DNS phonebook on your computer. Whenever you want to visit a website, your computer asks BIND, "Where can I find this website?" It's like asking a special phonebook reader to help you find someone's contact details.

BIND then searches the phonebook (DNS records) and locates the right entry for the website you're looking for. It provides your computer with the correct phone number (IP address), allowing you to connect to the website.

Therefore, BIND is not a separate entity from DNS; rather, it's a tool that helps computers use DNS effectively. It's important because it's the software that understands how to read and utilize the information in the DNS phonebook, ensuring that you access the correct websites while browsing the internet.

### What is a zone?

Imagine a zone in BIND as a section in a phonebook. Each section of a phonebook has a specific focus, such as all the people in a particular city or neighborhood.

Similarly, in BIND, a zone refers to a specific part of an internet domain that BIND is responsible for managing. It's like a particular section of the internet's phonebook that BIND supervises. For instance, there could be a zone for a website like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com), where all the information related to that website's address (IP address) and other associated details are stored.

When your computer requests BIND for information about a website, BIND searches the appropriate zone (section) in its phonebook to find the exact details and provide them back to your computer. This way, BIND helps your computer to connect to the right places on the internet, just like a phonebook manager helps you to find the correct contacts.

### Why there was a need to add a zone in our BIND?

Adding a zone in BIND is a useful function for managing your own domain on the internet. If you have a website, email server, or any other online services associated with your domain (e.g., [example.com](http://example.com)), you would usually add a zone in BIND to handle the DNS settings for your domain. Adding a zone in BIND is like having your own dedicated section in the phone book. Just as you might have a section for your family's contacts in your personal phone book, adding a zone lets you manage the DNS settings for your domain in the vast "phone book" of the internet.

Just like how you decide what information is listed for each contact in your personal phone book section, with a zone in BIND, you can decide how your domain's information is organized and shared on the internet. This includes specifying where your website is hosted, where your emails are sent, and any other services associated with your domain. By adding a zone in BIND, you have control over the DNS settings for your domain and can make changes and updates whenever you need to, without having to rely on others to manage it for you.

### A step-by-step guide to adding a zone in BIND:

* Use a text editor to open the BIND configuration file. This file is typically located at `/etc/bind/named.conf` or `/etc/named.conf` on Linux system.
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/named.conf
    ```
    
* Inside the BIND configuration file, locate the section where zone configurations are defined. If there's no existing zone configuration for your domain, add a new zone block like this:
    
    ```bash
    zone "example.com"{
        type master;
        file "/etc/bind/zones/example.com.zone";
    };
    ```
    
    Here `example.com` is the domain name. `type master` specifies that this BIND server is the primary source of information for the zone . `file` points to the zone file where the DNS server records for the domain will be stored.
    
* Create the zone file specified in the BIND configuration. For example, create `/etc/bind/zones/`[`example.com.zone`](http://example.com.zone)
    
    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/bind/zones/example.com.zone
    ```
    
* Populate the zone file with DNS records. Here's an example:
    
    ```plaintext
    ; This is a comment line. Comments start with a semicolon.
    
    $TTL 86400  ; Default TTL (Time To Live) for all records (in seconds)
    
    ; Start of Authority (SOA) record
    @   IN  SOA     ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                        2024022801 ; Serial number (increment for each change)
                        3600       ; Refresh (how often secondary servers check for updates)
                        1800       ; Retry (how often secondary servers retry after a failed refresh)
                        604800     ; Expire (how long secondary servers keep data if unable to refresh)
                        86400      ; Minimum TTL (minimum time-to-live for records)
                    )
    
    ; Name Server (NS) record
    @   IN  NS      ns1.example.com.   ; Primary name server
    
    ; Address (A) record for the name server
    ns1 IN  A       192.0.2.1           ; IP address of the name server
    
    ; Alias (CNAME) record
    www IN  CNAME   @                   ; Alias for the domain (www.example.com redirects to example.com)
    ```
    
    * The file starts with a comment explaining the purpose of the file.
        
    * `$TTL` sets the default time-to-live for records.
        
    * The Start of Authority (SOA) record specifies the primary name server and administrative contact.
        
    * The Name Server (NS) record specifies the primary name server for the domain.
        
    * The Address (A) record maps the hostname "ns1" to the IP address 192.0.2.1.
        
    * The Alias (CNAME) record creates an alias for the domain, redirecting [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/) to example.com.
        
* Once you have made changes , run `sudo systemctl restart named` command in your terminal.
    

By following these steps, you can manage the DNS settings for your domain in the vast "phone book" of the internet and ensure that your website, email server, or any other online services associated with your domain are accessible to your users.
