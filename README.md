# Blog Backup to GitHub

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the backup of my blogs from Hashnode to GitHub. This project aims to provide a secure and version-controlled backup of my valuable blog content. By storing my blogs on GitHub, I ensure a resilient backup solution and have the added benefit of version history tracking.

## How It Works

### 1. Hashnode Backup

I regularly export my blogs from Hashnode in a format compatible with this repository. The exported files, including Markdown files and associated media, are organized in a structured manner.

### 2. GitHub Repository

This repository hosts the backup of my blogs. Each blog post is represented by a separate Markdown file, and media assets are stored in an organized directory structure. The commit history serves as a version history tracker.


Feel free to clone or fork this repository for your reference or exploration.

## Contribution

While contributions to the content may not be applicable due to the personal nature of blogs, feel free to raise issues if you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvement.
